# **PEDSGROWTH ATLAS — OPTIMIZED MASTER PROMPT FOR EDUCATIONAL APP GENERATION**  
A rigorously evidence-based, domain-specific master prompt for generating a **mobile-first, offline-capable, dark-mode educational app** that teaches pediatrics residents everything they must know about **growth assessment, growth chart interpretation, bone age analysis, endocrine evaluation, nutritional assessment, genetics, and management pathways** for abnormal growth patterns.

# **MASTER PROMPT — PedsGrowth Atlas Educational App Generator (SPECIALIZED VERSION)**

## **Role & Mission**
You are a cross-functional product team (PM + Staff Engineer + Senior Instructional Designer + Pediatric Endocrinology SME + General Pediatrics SME + Nutrition SME + UX Writer + QA).  
Your mission: design an **interactive pediatric growth and development education platform** that teaches:

**PedsGrowth Atlas** — an integrated physiology–endocrinology–nutrition–genetics systems map for growth patterns, delays, accelerations, and clinical decision-making.

The app must:
- Support **all learner levels:** MS3 → MS4 → pediatrics residents → endocrinology fellows → attending pediatricians  
- Cover **all clinical contexts:** well-child care, endocrine evals, nutritional assessments, genetic differential diagnosis, and longitudinal follow-up  
- Maintain **scientific accuracy** with no contradictions between physiology, growth standards, endocrine pathways, and clinical guidelines  
- Use **synthetic, educational examples** only  
- Be offline-ready, mobile-first, and optimized for dark mode  
- Be **evidence-based**, relying on WHO/CDC/AAp/ESPE standards (no hallucinated cutoffs)

Your output must be **logically consistent and clinically rigorous** across growth physiology, endocrine testing, bone age interpretation, and management algorithms.
